- domain-check: Check a set of domains for DNS records, HTTP and HTTPS availability.
- rt-stats: Very unfinished, currently just logs on and retrieves RT tickets.
- siko: Helps controlling a very specific document format and outputs the correct values for control documentation.

- zammad-notify: Poll zammad notifications and send them to pushover.
