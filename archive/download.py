How to use:
- take a book out for a loan (1h)
- open web dev network console
- go to first page, hard-reload
- copy as curl, paste as COMMAND below
- replace the reference to the page with {page} â€“ it's the last part of the file= path, just before the .jp2
- go to last page, copy as curl to find last page number
- set PAGES to the last page number
- set BOOK to the book identifier (or whatever you want in your file name)

Run.

Once downloads start failing (after 50-100 pages, usually), you'll have to copy a new curl command. The script won't re-download existing images.

Once you are done, you'll want to combine the images. Several options:
- just zip them and rename the archive to .cbz
- for not too many pages, use convert directly: convert *.jpg -quality 100 book.pdf
- if that gets killed, you'll have to convert in two steps:
    - ls *.jpg | xargs -I% convert % %.pdf
    - pdftk *.pdf cat output book.pdf && rm *.jpg.pdf
